This project is only for educational purpose and shows how to build a simple App consisting of a Vue.js frontend and a Flask backend.

## Open Challenges

- Flask: addbook - handle nonexisting Book 'id'
- Vue.js: Think about where showMessage should be set to false. Update your code.
- Vue.js: Try using the Alert component to display errors.
- Vue.js: Refactor the alert to be dismissible.
- Flask: handle errors while adding books (already existing, wrong synthax etc.)
- Vue.js: handle errors while adding books (already existing, wrong synthax etc.)
- Vue.js: Handle Post and Put (addbook, updatebook) with a single Modal instead of 2
- Vue.js: Delete - Instead of deleting on the button click, add a confirmation alert.
- Vue.hs: Delete - Display a message saying, like "No books! Please add one.", when no books are present.

## Extended Challenges

- Get Books from an SQL DB (sqlalchemy + mysql for example)
